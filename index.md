# Name: Meng Yin (尹朦）

Hi there! My name is Meng Yin, and I am a PhD candidate in Finemechanics at Tohoku University. My research focuses on the use of first-principles calculations to study graphene-based gas sensors. Specifically, I am investigating the underlying mechanisms that govern the sensitivity and selectivity of these sensors to different gases.


In my current work, I use Denstiy Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to model the behavior of graphene-based gas sensors at the atomic and electronic levels. By combining these simulations with experimental data, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of the sensing mechanism and identify ways to improve the performance of these devices.


In the next step of my research, I plan to expand my investigations to include experimental studies of graphene-based gas sensors. By combining computational and experimental approaches, I hope to develop a comprehensive understanding of these sensors and pave the way for their use in a variety of applications.


If you're interested in learning more about my research or collaborating on a project, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
